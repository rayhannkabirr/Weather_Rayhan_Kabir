# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot throughout the project.
ChatGPT helped me generate structured explanations, debug Python functions, and refine my writing for documentation and reflection sections.
Copilot assisted with auto-completing code, suggesting relevant syntax, and speeding up repetitive programming tasks.

## Prompting Techniques
I applied intent-based prompting and iterative refinement.

I began with broad prompts (e.g., “Explain this function step by step”) to get an overview.

Then I refined with specific requests like “add code comments” or “simplify language.”

I also used role-based prompting — asking ChatGPT to act as a tutor or reviewer to get different perspectives.

## What Worked Well?
I’m proud that I successfully integrated AI tools effectively without over-relying on them.
They improved the quality of my work while allowing me to keep full control of the final logic and explanation.
My understanding of data flow, Python structures, and error handling improved significantly as a result.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would experiment with fine-tuning prompts and automating repetitive testing using AI-assisted scripts.
I would also explore AI visualization tools for generating dynamic graphs and dashboards directly from JSON or API responses.

## Final Thoughts
This project helped me appreciate how AI can act as both a collaborator and a tutor.
It made complex coding and documentation tasks more manageable and encouraged more reflective, structured thinking.
Overall, I’ve learned how to combine human judgment with AI efficiency to produce clearer, faster, and higher-quality outcomes.
